            <li> The competition has a bazillion levels of mindboggling cryptic connects.</li>
            <li>  Each level is worth points equal to level number. Thus Level 0 is worth 0 points, level 1 is worth 1, and level 30 is worth 30 points.</li>
            <li> At the end of the hunt, the participant with most points and least time wins.</li>
            <li> While answering there should not be any spaces and the letters should be lowercase. 'Lord Brahma' is wrong. It should be 'lordbrahma'. No special characters are allowed. Numbers are allowed.</li>
            <li> Google is your best friend. Don't be shy to use lots of search engines.</li>
            <li> Any suspicious activity like sharing answers or solving together will get you banned from the website or disqualified and barred from getting any prize/goodies.</li>
            <li> The decision made by Admins (All Hail The Great and Powerful Admins) would be final.</li>
